Web Application (REST-API) Sparta-Trainee Management System

Your task is to build a web application to manage the trainee records in sparta. Please check requirements as follows:
1-  The users can communicate with the app using REST APIs.
2-  The system should automatically save the spartan data in a JSON file (data.json) after each user action (i.e. API call)	-done, check again
3-  Each spartan should have the following data:	- done
    - spartan_id: Spartan ID (int)
    - first_name: First name (string: minimum 2 Characters)
    - last_name: Last Name (string: minimum 2 Characters)
    - birth_year: Birth Year (int between 1900 and 2004)
    - birth_month: Birth Month (int between 1 and 12)
    - birth_day: Birth Day (int between 1 and 31)
    - course: Course (string)
    - stream: Stream (string)

4-  The system should use Object Oriented to manage the spartan data.	-done
5-  Object variables should be dealt with using getters and setters only.	-done
6-  Organise your code to have main.py that would have all te routes and spartan.py for the Spartan class	-routes remaining
7-  You can test the spartan class by using a main code in the same file, the code should not be executed when this file is called by the main.py	-done

The following functionalities (and routes are expected to be implemented)

1-  method: GET, route: /	
  This is the landing page (Home page) and should return a welcome message along with a simple tutorial clarifying how APIs can be used

2-  method: POST, route: /spartan/add
  This API should allow the user to add new spartan to the system by passing a JSON object.

3-  method: GET, route: /spartan/<spartan_id>
  Get certain employee using the spartan_id. An error message should be returned if the spartan_id doesn't exist in the system. The data should be returned as string

4-  method: POST, route: /spartan/remove?id=sparta_id
  This API should allow the user to remove a spartan from the system by passing the sparta_id in the query_string

5-  method: GET, route: /spartan
  This API should return the spartan list as one JSON object.


Working Methodology:
1-  Start by creating a new git repository (spartan_project)	-done
2-  Create a new pycharm project and link it to the repository that you created.	-done
3-  Use commit after each step from now on	
4-  Start by creating all the routes (at this stage they will only be returning strings to show that they are working)
5-  Create the Class and test (locally) that you can create an object from the class
6-  Create a file called management.py and use it to add all the functions that will manage the sprtans		-done
7-  Use Postman to test your code: create new collection and create a new request for each API that you are testing
